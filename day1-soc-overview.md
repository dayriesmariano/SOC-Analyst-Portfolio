# Day 1 - SOC Overview

## What is a Security Operations Center (SOC)?
A security Operations Center (SOC) is a centralized team respomsible for monitoring, detecting, analyzing, and responding to cybersecurity incidents within an organization on a 24/7 basis.

The main goal of a SOC is to protect the organization's system, networks, and data from cyber threats.

## SOC Workflow
The SOC follows a structured workflow to handle security incidents:

1.Log Collection - Security logs are collected from servers, endpoints, network devices, and application.
2. Detection - Logs are analyzed and correlated using a SIEM tool to detect suspicious activities. 
3. Alert Triage - Analysts determine whether alerts are false positives or real threats.
4. Investigation - Detailed analysis is performed to understand the scope and impact of the incident.
Response - Actions such as blocking IPs, isolating systems, or resetting credentials are taken.
Documentation - Incidents are documented for reporting and future improvement.

## SOC Analyst Tiers

### Tier 1 - SOC Analyst
- Monitors alerts generated by SIEM tools
- Performs initial analysis and triage
- Escalates confirmed incidents to Tier 2

### Tier 2 - SOC Analyst 
- Coducts in-depth investigation
- Performs log correlation and root cause analysis
- Handles active incident response

### Tier 3 - SOC Analyst / Threat Hunder
- Proactively hunts for advanced threats 
- Develops detection rules 
- Improves SOC processes 

## Daily Responsibilities of a SOC Analyst 
- Monitor security alerts and dashboard
- Analyze logs from multiple sources
- Investigate suspicious activities
- Create incident tickets and reports
- Escalate incidents when necessary
